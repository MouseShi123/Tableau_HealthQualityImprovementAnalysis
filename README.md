The StateCare Quality Improvement Data Analytics using Tableau
DATA ANALYTICS ASSESSMENT BRIEF
BACKGROUND: The National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) maintains the Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS). HEDIS is one of health careâ€™s most widely used performance improvement tools and contains more than ninety measures across six domains of care. HEDIS data is submitted annually by state plans and other health organizations and is inclusive of both Medicaid and non-Medicaid beneficiaries. Annual HEDIS data reports are compiled by NCQA, and present values at state, regional and national levels.
The StateCare Quality Improvement Data Analytics team frequently works with the HEDIS data to provide trending information, benchmark data, and more. More about HEDIS: 
SOURCE DATA: File Name: Test_Data.xlsx
Data associated with the following six key screening measures have been downloaded from the HEDIS database, and staged in a Microsoft Excel file:
- Adult BMI Assessment (ABA)
- Breast Cancer Screening (BCS)
- Cervical Cancer Screening (CCS)
- Chlamydia Screening in Women (CHL)
- Diabetes Screening for People with Schizophrenia or Bipolar Disorder who are using Antipsychotic Medications (SSD)
- Lead Screening in Children (LSC)
Means and medians are provided for all measures, for calendar years 2017 and 2018. All data is available by US region. Measures are shown by Measure ID with the measure names and abbreviations on an additional tab. Please use all this information to complete the following tasks.
Data are presented as rates. (i.e., 99 = 99%)
PROBLEM STATEMENT: StateCare leadership is interested in opening a new analysis into HEDIS screening rates for the member population. Using the provided Excel source data file and any additional information as needed, complete the following tasks:
TASK 1 Choose only one measure from the measure list. Choose only one year. Create a graph which compares median performance, by region, for the chosen measure in the chosen year. Please provide an explanation of any key findings.
TASK 2 Consider all measures from the measure list and consider both years. Create a data table which succinctly presents all mean values, by region. Use filters where appropriate. Provide an explanation of any key findings.
This assessment should be completed in Tableau.
